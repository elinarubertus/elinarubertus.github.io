In recent years, I have developed a passion for science communication. It probably started in class when I put effort in how to simplify complex concepts to be understandable for undergraduates and how to convey the information in a captivating and sustainable way.

As a final project of a certified qualification program on science communication, I created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y9grhzLrug) to raise public awareness for developmental language disorders. This became a heartfelt topic that I continued to work on, for example in a [poster](/files/SES_Poster_final.pdf) for the Potsdam Science Day.

On several [Potsdam Science Days](https://potsdamertagderwissenschaften.de/), I also represented our laboratories in [posters](/files/Koartikulation_Poster_final.pdf) and set up interactive information stands for children and adults to learn more about their speech articulators, demonstrating how ultrasound tongue imaging works and which questions we can use it for in linguistic research. 

To inform the families of the BabyLAB's young participants about our ongoing studies as well as recent results, I described two of our studies in casual language targeted at the broad public. They can be found [here](/files/BabyLAB_Newsletter_2016_LOLA.pdf) and [here](/files/BabyLAB_Newsletter_LesArt.pdf).

I also took part in writing an article for Portal Wissen, a science magazine of the University of Potsdam, in which Aude Noiray and I introduced our laboratory and our ongoing studies. The article can be found [here](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/44088/file/portalwissen_2016_02.pdf) on pages 30-35.
