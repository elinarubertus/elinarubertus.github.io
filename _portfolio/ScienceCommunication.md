In recent years, I have developed a passion for science communication. It probably started in class when I put effort in how to simplify complex concepts to be understandable for undergraduates and how to convey the information in a captivating and sustainable way.

To inform the families of the BabyLAB's young participants about our ongoing studies as well as recent results, I described two of our studies in casual language targeted at the broad public. They can be found here and here.

I also took part in writing an article for Portal Wissen, a science magazine of the University of Potsdam, in which Aude Noiray and I introduced our laboratory and our ongoing studies. The article can be found [here](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/44088/file/portalwissen_2016_02.pdf) on pages 30-35.
