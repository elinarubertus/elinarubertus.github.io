**[Crossing the Borders](https://crossing-project.de/): The Interplay of Language, Cognition, and the Brain in Early Human Development**

...is a Research Unit funded by the DFG (German Research Foundation). Linguists and psychologists from several German universities and research institutes work together to investigate the interactions of language, cognition, social cognition, and their neuro-cognitive underpinnings in child development during the first years of life. Each project will cover one specific research topic in this field. All projects follow an interdisciplinary approach combining research perspectives from linguistics and psychology.

In this project, I have an administrative role. In 2023, I organized an international conference focussing on the results of the different subprojects as well as related topics. Currently, I am working in [Project Z](https://crossing-project.de/pz/).
