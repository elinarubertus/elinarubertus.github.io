As part of the CRC 1287 "Limits of Variability in Language: Cognitive, Computational, and Grammatical Aspects" at University of Potsdam, [Project T03 "Variability in speech input as a tool in language support and therapy for young children"](https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/en/projects/project-t03) (Prof. Dr. Barbara Höhle, Prof. Dr. Adamantios Gafos, Prof. Dr. Jan Lonnemann) aims to transfer the supportive effects that variability in the language input has on word learning into practical applications for promoting children's language development. We recruit volunteer language mentors, connect them with kindergartens whose children are in need of further support in the acquisition of German, and provide both opportunities for informal chatting and exchange as well as training meetings. T03 will develop training modules and practical materials for the language mentors that take the effects of variability into account. An evaluation study will assess the effectiveness of this variability-based support. The project collaborates with several non-commercial educational and social institutions.
