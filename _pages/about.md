I am fascinated by human language - especially by its phonological organization and phonetic realization. In my research, I investigate changes in speech production across childhood. Understanding in which aspects children's speech differs from adults' and how it develops, can inform us about the underlying phonological structure and provide insights into the phonology-phonetics interface. In my studies, I address spoken language in children and adults using acoustic as well as articulatory measures.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the bilateral French-German ANR/DFG-funded project VOC2SPEAK - An integrative-interactive approach to speech development at Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft [ZAS Berlin](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/de/). We will have a closer look at interactions of respiration, body movements, attention, and speech motor control with vocalizations and early speech in infancy.

Together with [Prof. Dr. Barbara Höhle (U Potsdam)](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/ling/staff-list/barbara-hoehle) and the association [Sprachpat*innen für Kita-Kinder e.V.](https://sprachpaten.berlin/), I recruit voluntary language mentors who support children with poor German language skills in their kindergartens. We offer workshops on the scientific background and support both the kindergartens as well as the volunteers. Here is [more information](\files\Projektinfo-Sprachpatenschaft.pdf), and our e-mail: sprachpaten@uni-potsdam.de.

Before, I worked in the DFG-project [“Crossing the borders: the interplay of language, cognition, and the brain in early human development”](https://crossing-project.de/) at the Linguistics department of University of Potsdam.
In March 2024, I successfully defended my [doctoral thesis](https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-63012) entitled "Coarticulatory changes across childhood – implications for speech motor and phonological development" that was supervised by [Aude Noiray, PhD (HDR) (U Grenoble Alpes)](https://noirayaude.wordpress.com/) and [Prof. Dr. Barbara Höhle (U Potsdam)](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/ling/staff-list/barbara-hoehle).

When I don't work, I spend time with my children (playing, baking, biking, ... and monitoring their language ;)). I love making music, both at the piano and in the [University's choir](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/chor-orchester/campus-cantabile-chor-der-universitaet-potsdam). During the summer months, I also enjoy Potsdam's lakes, best from inside a dragon boat.

This website is still under construction and I'm adding more and more content. So, happy browsing and stay tuned!
