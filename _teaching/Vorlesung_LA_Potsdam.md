This is an introductory lecture on first language acquisition dealing with the three braod topics phonology/phonetics, lexicon, and grammar, as well as empirical methods used for research on language acquisition. Because we mostly dealt with early language acquisition approximately in the first three years of life, phonological and phonetic developments were the focus of the class.
I held this lecture in the winter semesters 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.
